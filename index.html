						<div class="text">
						<p>Yo, my name is Filip and I like to keep it cool. When I'm not gaming or coding, I'm usually in school. I love pizza, Pokemon, Netflix, and dogs. I like to incorporate slant rhymes in my songs.</p>
						<p>In short, Computer Scientist who daylights as a Cognitive Scientist. Right now I'm working to get an internship that uses any combination of my majors.</p>
						<p>I'd like to preface this final project by saying I'm not nearly done with this site! I unfortunately started a bit late... However, I plan on using way more of the skills I learned in the Web Design decal to make this website awesome. </p>
