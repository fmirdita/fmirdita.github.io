    <h1>hi there~</h1>

    <p>
      Wow thanks for visiting my personal website I must be so important since there's an entire website for me that's crazy! Tbh I made this so I could put it on my resume, but I'm going to try to make this my primary outlet for updating those interested. #tiredofsocialmedia

    <h1>who's filip?</h1>
    <p>
      Hi I’m Filip with an "F," and the history books are going to refer to me as a Golden Renaissance Californian. My passions are minds, computers, art, and science, and typically in that order.
    </p> 
    <h1>does he really spell his name like that?</h1>
    <p>
      Well if you haven't heard the spiel already, my dad was born in Yugoslavia (which no longer exists) and his family considers themselves Albanian (even though they come from Montenegro) and his dad's name was Filip (who refers to me as Filip Jr. even though it skipped a generation) and our family name, Mirdita (originally Miridita) means "Good Day" in Albanian.
    </p>
    <p>
      My experience at UC Berkeley has opened my eyes to the world. As a first-generation Albanian American, my low-income background had kept me from really getting out of Sacramento. Unique to most double majors, my studies allowed me to study abroad, twice. These study abroad programs, with the help of scholarships and my occupation as a student program manager, let me spend over 8 months in 9 countries, the majority of which I was studying and living abroad. Home in California I suddenly found myself immersed in an intensely intellectual environment with a new perspective. As a software engineer, I’m enthralled in tackling the most difficult problems and find myself generally solution-oriented. As a cognitive scientist, I find the state of the human world just as fascinating as each of its individuals. I understand the strength of human cooperation and ultimately I see that my education has equipped me to contribute valuable work to important, powerful technologies and psychotechnologies in many ways for years to come.
    </p>  
    <p>
      As a next step, I plan on working with tech companies in the Bay Area. My ability and determination makes today’s era of Blockchain, Virtual Reality, and Machine Learning seem a wonderland of new exciting and interesting technologies. In the decades ahead, I see a sure path of discovery and exploration of the human mind alongside technology at large.
